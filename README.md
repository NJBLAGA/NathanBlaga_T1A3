## **User Interaction and experience:**

Zop is being developed with the intention of providing the user with a fun and error free experience. Zop's desgin and menu system aids in navigating the player through the games variours menus without any hassle or stress. Built for seasoned experts or new users, Zop aims to guide the player from starting Zop up, to entering their name, to spending hours trying to get a perfect run on all levels. None of Zop features are hidden or need a considerable effort by the player to utilise them. Instead the features are provided and displayed to the player from the very onset of Zop asking them their first question. The features of Zop were built with the intention to aid the player's experience and so it was vital to instruct the player through the rules and instruction menu on said features and game mechanics.

The end of question panel feature provided by Zop to the player help to enhance their in game experience. By providing a constant feed of infomation inbetween questions, the player is able to see if they are one question away from completing the level or failing it. Another feature of Zop that excels at enhancing the players experience is that of Zop prompting the playing they have entered a invalid answer. This allows the player to continue to progress through the level without the Zop awarding them a correct or incorrect answer based on the player mistyping their answer or not understanding what they are supposed to enter in the first place.
